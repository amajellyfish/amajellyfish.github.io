## Using Modules to Manage Packages

Modules used to manage packages:
![Image](../../../img/12tab02.jpg)

#### Configuring Repository Access

The **yum_repository** module lets you work with yum repository files in the /etc/yum.repos.d/ directory.

```yaml
    ---
    - name: setting up repository access
      hosts: all
      tasks:
      - name: connect to example repo
        yum_repository:
          name: example repo
          description: RHCE8 example repo
          file: examplerepo
          baseurl: ftp://control.example.com/repo/
          gpgcheck: no
```

yum_repository Key Arguments

![Image](../../../img/12tab03.jpg)

Use of the **gpgcheck** argument is recommended but not mandatory. 
Most repositories are provided with a GPG key to verify that packages in the repository have not been tampered with. However, if no
GPG key is set up for the repository, the **gpgcheck** parameter can be set to no to skip checking the GPG key.

#### Managing Software with yum

The yum module can be used to manage software packages. You use it to
install and remove packages or to update packages. This can be done for
individual packages, as well as package groups and modules. Let's look
at some examples that go beyond the mere installation or removal of
packages, which was covered sufficiently in earlier chapters.

[Listing 12-2](#ch12.xhtml#list12_2) shows a module that will update all
packages on this system.

**Listing 12-2** Using yum to Perform a System Update

::: pre_1
    ---
    - name: updating all packages
      hosts: ansible2
      tasks:
      - name: system update
        yum:
          name: ’*’
          state: latest
:::

Notice the use of the **name** argument to the yum module. It has
**'\*'** as its argument. To prevent the wildcard from being interpreted
by the shell, you must make sure it is placed between single quotes.

[Listing 12-3](#ch12.xhtml#list12_3) shows an example where yum package
groups are used to install the Virtualization Host package group.

**Listing 12-3** Installing Package Groups

::: pre_1
    ---
    - name: install or update a package group
      hosts: ansible2
      tasks:
      - name: install or update a package group
        yum:
          name: ’@Virtualization Host’
          state: latest
:::

When a yum package group instead of an individual package needs to be
installed, the name of the package group needs to start with an at sign
(@), and the entire package group name needs to be put between single
quotes. Also notice the use of **state: latest** in [Listing
12-3](#ch12.xhtml#list12_3). This line ensures that the packages in the
package group are installed if they have not been installed yet. If they
have already been installed, they are updated to the latest version.

A new feature in RHEL 8 is the yum AppStream module. Modules as listed
by the Linux **yum modules list** command can be managed with the
Ansible yum module also. Working with yum modules is similar to working
with yum package groups. In the example in [Listing
12-4](#ch12.xhtml#list12_4), the main difference is that a version
number and the installation profile are included in the module name.

**Listing 12-4** Installing AppStream Modules with the yum Module

::: pre_1
    ---
    - name: installing an AppStream module
      hosts: ansible2
      tasks:
      - name: install or update an AppStream module
        yum:
          name: ’@php:7.3/devel’
          state: present
:::

::: note

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Note**

When using the yum module to install multiple packages, you can provide
the **name** argument with a list of multiple packages. Alternatively,
you can provide multiple packages in a loop. Of these solutions, using a
list of multiple packages as the argument to **name** is always
preferred. If multiple package names are provided in a loop, the module
must execute a task for every single package. If multiple package names
are provided as the argument to **name**, yum can install all these
packages in one single task.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

#### Managing Package Facts {.h4}

When Ansible is gathering facts, package facts are not included. To
include package facts as well, you need to run a separate task; that is,
you need to use the package_facts module. Facts that have been gathered
about packages are stored to the ansible_facts.packages variable. The
sample playbook in [Listing 12-5](#ch12.xhtml#list12_5) shows how to use
the package_facts module.

**Listing 12-5** Using the package_facts Module to Show Package Details

::: pre_1
    ---
    - name: using package facts
      hosts: ansible2
      vars:
        my_package: nmap
      tasks:
      - name: install package
        yum:
          name: "{{ my_package }}"
          state: present
      - name: update package facts
        package_facts:
          manager: auto
      - name: show package facts for {{ my_package }}
        debug:
          var: ansible_facts.packages[my_package]
        when: my_package in ansible_facts.packages
:::

As you can see, the package_facts module does not need much to do its
work. The only argument used here is the **manager** argument, which
specifies which package manager to communicate to. Its default value of
**auto** automatically detects the appropriate package manager and uses
that. If you want, you can specify the package manager manually, using
any package manager such as yum or dnf. [Listing
12-6](#ch12.xhtml#list12_6) shows the output of running the [Listing
12-5](#ch12.xhtml#list12_5) playbook, where you can see details that are
collected by the package_facts module.

**Exercise 12-1 Managing Software Packages**

1\. Use your editor to create a new file with the name exercise121.yaml.

2\. Write a play header that defines the variable **my_package** and
sets its value to **virt-manager**:

``` pre1
---
- name: exercise121
  hosts: ansible2
  vars:
    my_package: virt-manager
  tasks:
```

3\. Add a task that installs the package based on the name of the
variable that was provided:

``` pre1
- name: install package
  yum:
    name: "{{ my_package }}"
    state: present
```

4\. Add a task that gathers facts about installed packages:

``` pre1
- name: update package facts
  package_facts:
    manager: auto
```

5\. As the last part of this exercise, add a task that shows facts about
the package that you have just installed:

``` pre1
- name: show package facts for {{ my_package }}
  debug:
    var: ansible_facts.packages[my_package]
  when: my_package in ansible_facts.packages
```

6\. Run the playbook using **ansible-playbook exercise121.yaml** and
verify its output.

## Using Modules to Manage Repositories and Subscriptions

To work with software packages, you need to make sure that repositories
are accessible and subscriptions are available. In the previous section
you learned how to write a playbook that enables you to access an
existing repository. In this section you learn how to set up the server
part of a repository if that still needs to be done. Also, you learn how
to manage RHEL subscriptions using Ansible.

#### Setting Up Repositories {.h4}

Most managed systems access the default distributions that are provided
while installing the operating system. In some cases external
repositories might not be accessible. If that happens, you need to set
up a repository yourself. Before you can do that, however, it's
important to know what a repository is. A repository is a directory that
contains RPM files, as well as the repository metadata, which is an
index that allows the repository client to figure out which packages are
available in the repository.

Ansible does not provide a specific module to set up a repository. You
must use a number of modules instead. Exactly which modules are involved
depends on how you want to set up the repository. For instance, if you
want to set up an FTP-based repository on the Ansible control host, you
need to accomplish the following tasks:

• Install the FTP package.

• Start and enable the FTP server.

• Open the firewall for FTP traffic.

• Make sure the FTP shared repository directory is available.

• Download packages to the repository directory.

• Use the Linux **createrepo** command to generate the index that is
required in each repository.

The playbook in [Listing 12-7](#ch12.xhtml#list12_7) provides an example
of how this can be done.

**Listing 12-7** Setting Up an FTP-based Repository

::: pre_1
    - name: install FTP to export repo
      hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: install FTP server
        yum:
          name:
          - vsftpd
          - createrepo_c
          state: latest
      - name: start FTP server
        service:
          name: vsftpd
          state: started
          enabled: yes
      - name: open firewall for FTP
        firewalld:
          service: ftp
          state: enabled
          permanent: yes
    
    - name: setup the repo directory
      hosts: localhost
      tasks:
      - name: make directory
        file:
          path: /var/ftp/repo
          state: directory
      - name: download packages
        yum:
          name: nmap
          download_only: yes
          download_dir: /var/ftp/repo
      - name: createrepo
        command: createrepo /var/ftp/repo
:::

The most significant tasks in setting up the repository are the
**download packages** and **createrepo** tasks. In the **download
packages** task, the yum module is used to download a single package. To
do so, the **download_only** argument is used to ensure that the package
is not installed but downloaded to a directory. When you use the
**download_only** argument, you also must specify where the package
needs to be installed. To do this, the task uses the **download_dir**
argument.

There is one disadvantage in using this approach to download the
package, though: it requires repository access. If repository access is
not available, the fetch module can be used instead to download a file
from a specific URL.

#### Managing GPG Keys {.h4}

To guarantee the integrity of packages, most repositories are set up
with a GPG key. This enables the client to verify that packages have not
been tampered with while transmitted between the repository server and
client. For that reason, if packages are installed from a repository
server on the Internet, you should always make sure that **gpgcheck:
yes** is set while using the yum_repository module.

However, if you want to make sure that a GPG check is performed, you
need to make sure the client knows where to fetch the repository key. To
help with that, you can use the rpm_key module. You can see how to do
this in [Listing 12-8](#ch12.xhtml#list12_8). Notice that the playbook
in this listing doesn't work because no GPG-protected repository is
available. Setting up GPG-protected repositories is complex and outside
the scope of the EX294 objectives, and for that reason is not covered
here.

**Listing 12-8** Using rpm_key to Fetch an RPM Key

::: pre_1
    - name: use rpm_key in repository access
      hosts: all
      tasks:
      - name: get the GPG public key
        rpm_key:
          key: ftp://control.example.com/repo/RPM-GPG-KEY
          state: present
      - name: set up the repository client
        yum_repository:
          file: myrepo
          name: myrepo
          description: example repo
          baseurl: ftp://control.example.com/repo
          enabled: yes
          gpgcheck: yes
          state: present
:::

#### Managing RHEL Subscriptions {.h4}

When you work with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, configuring repository
access using the method described before is not enough. Red Hat
Enterprise Linux works with subscriptions, and to be able to access
software that is provided through your subscription entitlement, you
need to set up managed systems to access these subscriptions.

::: note

------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Tip**

Free developer subscriptions are available for RHEL as well as Ansible.
Register yourself at <https://developers.redhat.com> and sign up for a
free subscription if you want to test the topics described in this
section on RHEL and you don't have a valid subscription yet.

------------------------------------------------------------------------
:::

To understand how to use the Ansible modules to register a RHEL system,
you need to understand how to use the Linux command-line utilities. When
you are managing subscriptions from the Linux command line, multiple
steps are involved.

1\. First, you use the **subscription-manager register** command to
provide your RHEL credentials. Use, for instance, **subscription-manager
register \--username=yourname \--password=yourpassword**.

2\. Next, you need to find out which pools are available in your
account. A pool is a collection of software channels available to your
account. Use **subscription-manager list \--available** for an overview.

3\. Now you can connect to a specific pool using **subscription-manager
attach \--pool=*poolID***. Note that if only one subscription pool is
available in your account, you don't have to provide the **\--pool**
argument.

4\. Next, you need to find out which additional repositories are
available to your account by using **subscription-manager repos
\--list**.

5\. To register to use additional repositories, you use
**subscription-manager repos \--enable "repos name"**. Your system then
has full access to its subscription and related repositories.

Two significant modules are provided by Ansible:

• **redhat_subscription:** This module enables you to perform
subscription and registration in one task.

• **rhsm_repository:** This module enables you to add subscription
manager repositories.

[Listing 12-9](#ch12.xhtml#list12_9) shows an example of a playbook that
uses these modules to fully register a new RHEL 8 machine and add a new
repository to the managed machine. Notice that this playbook is not
runnable as such because important additional information needs to be
provided. [Exercise 12-3](#ch12.xhtml#exe12_3), later in the section
titled "Implementing a Playbook to Manage Software," will guide you to a
scenario that shows how to use this code in production.

**Listing 12-9** Using Subscription Manager to Set Up Ansible

::: pre_1
    ---
    - name: use subscription manager to register and set up repos
      hosts: ansible5
      tasks:
      - name: register and subscribe ansible5
        redhat_subscription:
          username: bob@example.com
          password: verysecretpassword
          state: present
      - name: configure additional repo access
        rhsm_repository:
          name:
          - rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
          - rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-debug-rpms
          state: present
:::

In the sample playbook in [Listing 12-9](#ch12.xhtml#list12_9), you can
see how the redhat_subscription and rhsm_repository modules are used.
Notice that redhat_subscription requires a password. In [Listing
12-9](#ch12.xhtml#list12_9) the username and password are provided as
clear-text values in the playbook. From a security perspective, this is
very bad practice. You should use Ansible Vault instead. [Exercise
12-3](#ch12.xhtml#exe12_3) will guide you through a setup where this is
done.

In [Exercise 12-2](#ch12.xhtml#exe12_2) you are guided through the
procedure of setting up your own repository and using it. This procedure
consists of two distinct parts. In the first part you set up a
repository server that is based on FTP. Because in Ansible you often
need to configure topics that don't have your primary attention, you set
up the FTP server and also change its configuration. Next, you write a
second playbook that configures the clients with appropriate repository
access, and after doing so, install a package.

::: box
**Exercise 12-2 Setting Up a Repository**

1\. Use your editor to create the file exercise122-server.yaml.

2\. Define the play that sets up the basic FTP configuration. Because
all its tasks should be familiar to you at this point, you can enter all
the tasks at once:

``` pre1
---
- name: install, configure, start and enable FTP
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: install FTP server
    yum:
      name: vsftpd
      state: latest
  - name: allow anonymous access to FTP
    lineinfile:
      path: /etc/vsftpd/vsftpd.conf
      regexp: ’^anonymous_enable=NO’
      line: anonymous_enable=YES
  - name: start FTP server
    service:
      name: vsftpd
      state: started
      enabled: yes
  - name: open firewall for FTP
    firewalld:
      service: ftp
      state: enabled
      immediate: yes
      permanent: yes
```

3\. Set up a repository directory. Add the following play to the
playbook. Notice the use of the download packages task, which uses the
yum module to download a package without installing it. Also notice the
createrepo task, which creates the repository metadata that converts the
/var/ftp/repo directory into a repository.

``` pre1
- name: setup the repo directory
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - name: make directory
    file:
      path: /var/ftp/repo
      state: directory
  - name: download packages
    yum:
      name: nmap
      download_only: yes
      download_dir: /var/ftp/repo
  - name: install createrepo package
    yum:
      name: createrepo_c
      state: latest
  - name: createrepo
    command: createrepo /var/ftp/repo
    notify:
    - restart_ftp
  handlers:
  - name: restart_ftp
    service:
      name: vsftpd
      state: restarted
```

4\. Use the command **ansible-playbook exercise122-server.yaml** to set
up the FTP server on control.example.com. If you haven't made any typos,
you shouldn't encounter any errors.

5\. Now that the repository server has been installed, it's time to set
up the repository client. Use your editor to create the file
exercise122-client.yaml and write the play header as follows:

``` pre1
---
- name: configure repository
  hosts: all
  vars:
    my_package: nmap
  tasks:
```

6\. Add a task that uses the yum_repository module to configure access
to the new repository:

``` pre1
- name: connect to example repo
  yum_repository:
    name: exercise122
    description: RHCE8 exercise 122 repo
    file: exercise122
    baseurl: ftp://control.example.com/repo/
    gpgcheck: no
```

7\. After setting up the repository client, you also need to make sure
that the clients know how to reach the repository server by addressing
its name. Add the next task that writes a new line to /etc/hosts to make
sure host name resolving on the clients is set up correctly:

``` pre1
- name: ensure control is resolvable
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    line: 192.168.4.200  control.example.com  control

- name: install package
  yum:
    name: "{{ my_package }}"
    state: present
```

8\. If you are using the package_facts module, you need to remember to
update it after installing new packages. Add the following task to get
this done:

``` pre1
- name: update package facts
  package_facts:
    manager: auto
```

9\. As the last task, just because it's fun, use the debug module
together with the package facts to get information about the newly
installed package:

``` pre1
- name: show package facts for {{ my_package }}
  debug:
    var: ansible_facts.packages[my_package]
  when: my_package in ansible_facts.packages
```

10\. Use the command **ansible-playbook exercise122-client.yaml -e
my_package=redis**. That's right; this command overwrites the my_package
variable that was set in the playbook---just to remind you a bit about
variable precedence.
:::

### Implementing a Playbook to Manage Software 

In the previous sections you learned how to use different modules to
manage software. In this section you apply this knowledge in a more
advanced playbook example. You'll also find an advanced example like
this in Chapters 13 through 15 so that you get the best possible
preparation for the EX294 exam. To match the exam style of questions,
the example is scenario based, and the assignment is formatted as a
step-by-step exercise. As is the case for all exercises, the complete
playbook discussed here is available in the GitHub repository at
<https://github.com/sandervanvugt/rhce8-book/exercise123.yaml>.

To run this assignment on a RHEL 8 target, you need access to a valid
RHEL 8 subscription. If you don't have a current subscription, you can
request it from <https://developers.redhat.com>.

::: box
**Exercise 12-3 Configuring a New RHEL Managed Node**

Create a playbook that will fully automate the setup of a new RHEL host.
Write this playbook according to the following requirements:

• Add the new host information to the inventory and /etc/hosts file on
the control host.

• Work with variables for the name of the host you want to set up.

• Connect as user root to the new host. While running the playbook, run
it with the appropriate option so that you will be prompted for the root
password.

• Set up the user ansible on the new host and make sure this user is a
member of the group wheel.

• Also, set a password for user ansible using the playbook.

• Modify the sudoers file such that the user ansible can run root
commands using sudo without having to enter a password.

• Automatically register the host with the RHEL Subscription Manager.

• Use Ansible Vault to provide the username and password in a secure
way.

• Add the new host to the rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
repository and the rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-debug-rpms repository.

• Use tags so that you can run individual parts of the playbook.

1\. On the control host, use **sudo yum install sshpass** to install the
sshpass package. This package enables you to work with SSH passwords in
a noninteractive way, and you need it to automate working with SSH
passwords from a playbook environment.

2\. To start, you need to set up the control host to include information
about the new host. To make this playbook flexible, this playbook
requires variables to be set from the command line because that is the
only way to ensure that the variable is available in all of the plays.
Using **vars_prompt** would have been an option, but variables that are
set with **vars_prompt** apply only to the play in which they are set.
To check that the variables were indeed passed as an argument to the
**ansible-playbook** command, use the fail module as follows to check
whether the variable **newhost** and the variable **newhostip** are
provided as startup arguments. Create a file with the name
exercise123.yaml as follows:

``` pre1
- name: add host to inventory
  hosts: localhost
  tasks:
  - fail:
      msg: "add the options -e newhost=hostname -e newhostip=ip.ad.dr.ess and try again"
    when: (newhost is undefined) or (newhostip is undefined)
```

3\. Write the tasks for this first play. In these tasks, you want to
make sure that the local inventory file and the /etc/hosts file are
modified. To do this, the lineinfile module provides good service.
Notice the use of the line the second time the lineinfile module is
called. The line contains only variables, and for that reason the entire
variable string must be between double quotes. Also, at the end of the
play, include the **tags: addhost** line, which makes it easy to skip
this task after it has run successfully in case it is needed to run the
playbook again. Make sure to add the following text to complete the
first play:

``` pre1
- name: add new host to inventory
  lineinfile:
    path: inventory
    state: present
    line: "{{ newhost }}"
- name: add new host to /etc/hosts
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/hosts
    state: present
    line: "{{ newhostip }}  {{ newhost}}"
tags: addhost
```

4\. At this point it's a good idea to test that all is going well so
far. Use **ansible-playbook -C exercise123.yaml** and observe playbook
output. It should fail because no arguments are provided on the command
line. Use **ansible-playbook -C exercise123.yaml -e newhost=ansible5 -e
newhostip=192.168.4.205** and try again.

5\. The first play is ready at this point, so it's time to configure the
second play. This play is executed on the new host. The target host name
is set to the variable **newhost**, which is defined while running the
**ansible-playbook** command. Also notice that the **remote_user** and
the **become** statements must be set because the default user ansible
is not configured for privilege escalation yet. Write the play header
for this second play as follows:

``` pre1
- name: configure a new RHEL host
  hosts: "{{ newhost }}"
  remote_user: root
  become: false
  tasks:
```

6\. Now it's time to add the tasks, as well as the tag to this play. In
the tasks you need to make sure a user ansible exists and is a member of
the group wheel. Next, you use the shell module to set a password for
the user ansible. It's an ugly approach, but it works. In [Chapter
13](#ch13.xhtml#ch13), "[Managing Users](#ch13.xhtml#ch13)," you'll
learn how to do this in a much nicer way. As the next task you use the
lineinfile module to modify the /etc/sudoers file and allow members of
the group wheel to escalate permissions without entering a password. Add
the tasks to do this as follows:

``` pre1
- name: configure user ansible
  user:
    name: ansible
    groups: wheel
    append: yes
    state: present
- name: set a password for this user
  shell: ’echo password | passwd --stdin ansible’
- name: enable sudo without passwords
  lineinfile:
    path: /etc/sudoers
    regexp: ’^%wheel’
    line: ’%wheel ALL=(ALL)  NOPASSWD: ALL’
    validate: /usr/sbin/visudo -cf %s
```

7\. With this part you have set up the user ansible on the managed host,
but one element is still missing: the user cannot log in with an SSH
public/private key pair yet. In [Chapter 13](#ch13.xhtml#ch13) you'll
learn about a nice way to add the SSH public key to the remote user; for
now you can do it in a quick-and-dirty way that will also work. Add the
following lines to the playbook to conclude the second play:

``` pre1
- name: create SSH directory in user ansible home
  file:
    path: /home/ansible/.ssh
    state: directory
    owner: ansible
    group: ansible
- name: copy SSH public key to remote host
  copy:
    src: /home/ansible/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
    dest: /home/ansible/.ssh/authorized_keys
tags: setuphost
```

8\. Feel free to test the second play at this point; it's better to
filter out any errors now than to do it later. To test, use
**ansible-playbook -C -k exercise123.yaml -e newhost=ansible5 -e
newhostip=192.168.4.205**. Notice the use of the **-k** option, which
prompts for the SSH password that user root in this play needs to set up
the target host.

9\. At this point your RHEL host should be ready for use. The only thing
that is still missing is that it has not been registered against Red Hat
Subscription Manager. To do this, you need your Red Hat credentials.
Because these credentials are sensitive information, you should use
Ansible Vault. So let's start creating the vault file and define the
username and password variables in the Vault file. To create the Vault
file, use **ansible-vault create exercise123-vault.yaml** and provide
the following input, where you should use your real username and
password and not *XXXXXXXXX*. Your rhsm_user name is the name (typically
an email address) that you use to log in at redhat.com, and the
rhsm_password is the password that you use with it. Also notice that for
obvious security reasons, this file is NOT provided in the GitHub
repository that comes with this book:

``` pre1
rhsm_user: XXXXXXXXXXX
rhsm_password: XXXXXXXXXXX
```

10\. Now that you have created the Vault file, you can write the header
for the third and last play in the file exercise123.yaml. The most
important part of this header is the **vars_files** part, which refers
to the Vault file:

``` pre1
- name: use subscription manager to register and set up repos
  hosts: "{{ newhost }}"
  vars_files:
  - exercise123-vault.yaml
  tasks:
```

11\. At this point you can complete the playbook and add the remaining
tasks:

``` pre1
- name: register and subscribe {{ newhost }}
  redhat_subscription:
    username: "{{ rhsm_user }}"
    password: "{{ rhsm_password }}"
    state: present
- name: configure additional repo access
  rhsm_repository:
    name:
    - rh-gluster-3-client-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
    - rhel-8-for-x86_64-appstream-debug-rpms
    state: present
tags: registerhost
```

12\. At this point the playbook is ready. Compare what you have written
to the sample playbook exercise123.yaml that is in the GitHub repository
and give it a try. To do so, use the **ansible-playbook -k
\--ask-vault-pass exercise123.yaml -e newhost=ansible5 -e
newhostip=192.168.4.205** command. Everything should be running
smoothly, but because this is a large playbook and it is very difficult
to write it without typos right from the beginning, you might have to do
a little bit of troubleshooting. To do so, I recommend that you use the
tags that have been provided with the plays. If, after running the first
and second plays successfully, the third play generates an error, you
can run just that play again, using **ansible-playbook
\--tags=registerhost exercise123.yaml -e newhost=ansible5**. (Notice
that this command doesn't use as many command-line options as the
command you used just a minute ago because these parameters don't apply
to the **registerhost** tag.)
:::


### Lab 12-1 

Configure the control.example.com host as a repository server, according
to the following requirements:

• Create a directory with the name /repo, and in that directory copy all
packages that have a name starting with nginx.

• Generate the metadata that makes this directory a repository.

• Configure the Apache web server to provide access to the repository
server. You just have to make sure that the DocumentRoot in Apache is
going to be set to the /repo directory.

### Lab 12-2 {#ch12.xhtml#h3_164 .h3}

Write a playbook to configure all managed servers according to the
following requirements:

• All hosts can access the repository that was created in Lab 12-1.

• Have the same playbook install the nginx package.

• Do NOT start the service. Use the appropriate module to gather
information about the installed nginx package, and let the playbook
print a message stating the name of the nginx package as well as the
version.
