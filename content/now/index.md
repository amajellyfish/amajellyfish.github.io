What I am up to [Now](https://nownownow.com/about).

I am currently working out a new process for actually following through with my quarterly goals. Focusing on the process more than the goal. 

I have also started practicing drum rudiments again. Currently reading "A Fresh Approach to the Snare Drum" as time permits. 

Spending evenings playing board games with the family and playing with our dog. 

### Quarterly Goals
Get down to 190lbs.  
~~Finish website design and push to production.~~  
Taper off of caffeine.  
Build study habit up to 45 minutes per day.
