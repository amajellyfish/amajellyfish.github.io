I also keep a Master List of all of the books I have read and a Book Graveyard of books I didn\u0026rsquo;t finish.\nThe Willpower Instinct ★★★★★ I picked up a bunch of new habits in the past couple months since reading this. Positive habits are self-perpetuating. So are negative ones. Dopamine Nation ★★★★★ Our brains are not adapted for a world of abundance. So the forces that kept us alive for thousands of years, are now making us miserable. Consider this a primer into understanding addiction and over consumption. And steps you can take to mitigate this. Good Inside ★★★★★ We must separate the child from the behavior. Often, when a child's behavior appears as \"bad\", it's really the child having a big emotion that they can't regulate in a controlled way. The Relationship Handbook ★★★★★ People can be mean if they are in a bad mood. Forgive them for what they say and have a fresh start. The Power of Positive Dog Training ★★★★★ Dog training without being a jerk. Any dog can be trained with progressive reinforcement techniques. The author even explains why aversive training not only doesn’t work, but it makes problems sprout up in other areas of your dogs life. Nonviolent Communication ★★★★★ Easy concepts to grasp, challenging to apply to the real world. This is how we communicate with other people. This is going to need a re-read at some point. Meditations ★★★★☆ This book makes me want to keep a better journaling habit. And study philosophy. And not worry about things that do not matter. Because we all become dust in the end anyway. Caffeine Blues ★★★★☆ Everyone should read this book. Caffeine does more than just block adenosine receptors so you don't feel tired. Caffeine = Stress. The Psychology of Money ★★★★☆ Holy cow was this eye opening. Not only in regards to money, but the principles apply to many aspects of life. Strong story telling, clear and concise. Worth reading multiple times. Million Dollar Weekend ★★★★☆ Motivational, inspiring, and practical. I will be coming back to these notes over and over as I embark on my business ventures. Don't be afraid to ask for what you want. In fact, develop your asking powers like a muscle. Also, don't try to figure out how to do something before you start. Just start and figure out how along the way. Anything You Want ★★★★☆ Quick read about creating the business (and life) that you want. Life isn't all about maximizing profits and accelerated growth. Do what makes you happy. Treat your customers like rock stars and they will tell everyone. The 12 Week Year ★★★☆☆ Solid advice on establishing a vision, settings goals, measuring the effectiveness of your actions, and other tidbits about being effective and taking action. I have been implementing most of this and needed to go back through to make sure I've got down the process. The Blog Startup ★★★☆☆ If you are wanting to blog as a business, you need a sound strategy and business model. Filled with practical tips on identifying your audience, email strategy, branding, marketing, things to watch out for, etc. Definitely read this if you are wanting to start a blog. 1-2-3 Magic ★★☆☆☆ Don't argue with your kids. Manage behavior without getting angry. Very easy to use \"breaks\" and rewards to try and manipulate your child instead of teaching lessons and trying to get activities to be enjoyable in and of themselves.
